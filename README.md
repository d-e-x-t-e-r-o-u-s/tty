# D-E-X-T-E-R-O-U-S TTY

A lightweight travel split 34/36 keyboard with optional rotary encoders.
end of the line in the D-E-X-T-E-R-O-U-S travel series (probably).
This board is compatible with Kailh choc V1 and V2 switches.

## D-E-X-T-E-R-O-U-S travel series

My goal is to create a series of super lightweight split-ergo travel keyboards that can iteratively introduce people to compact split-ergo boards.
Looking at a 34 key board when you're used to a full-size board usually leads to more than a few questions and comments regarding the sanity of it's users.
My goal is to create a series of configurable pre-built boards that can help people find their ideal keycount.
I've started at the end of the spectrum with a 34 key layout as it's the board I (Think I) want myself.

## Features

-   Split 34/36 key layout
-   Configurable with 1 or 2 rotary encoders
-   1.5U main thumbkeys

### The inner thumb keys

The third thumb-key on each side where the rotary-encoders can optionally be placed is a bit of a stretch if you use them as keys rather than encoders.
As such this is really a 34 key keyboard with two optional keys for less-used macros (I personally use them for navigating vim/tmux windows).
I'd advise against using these keys for mods or layer switching.

# D-E-X-T-E-R-O-U-S

My goal in building and selling boards is to be able to support myself while I contribute to various open-source keyboard related projects. If I can support myself full-time I'll contribute full-time.
Because I have a family I haven't been able to carve out the time I've wanted to contribute to the open-source community. As a heavy open-source user, I'd like to be able to give mero back.
This project is my attempt to give back in a sustainable way.

## Initial goals

1. Vial - I love Vial, first mission is to make this a bit more split/column-stagger friendly. There are a few usability improvements I'd like to make.
2. KLE - I want to create a new keyboard design tool in the vein of KLE but more user-friendly and geared towards designing boards rather than just layouts (generate qmk configurations, KiCad plugin, better split support, better transformations and UI)
3. QMK - I'm not sure what that looks like yet - probably just picking up some issues until something interesting pops up.
4. ZMK - I'll see where I can help out in terms of ZMK, I'll probably contribute mostly to ZMK Studio.
5. LCD animations/demos - haven't designed a board with a screen yet, but as soon as I do I'll be working on low-memory animations and graphics for qmk driven screens. Because static images take loads of flash, making a library of teeny keeb demos would be a fun diversion.

### Supporting me

I'm just getting started with the project - so the proof will be in the eventual pudding (I don't have much track-record in open-source as I've been feeding mouths), As such if you want to support me - please consider buying a board, as this is a much more reasonable exchange than just throwing money my way.
But if you really want to take a punt in the value I'll offer the community you can do so on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/DEXTEROUS). If you support me on Patreon you'll get access to limited-run designs, updates on my progress, and any other random stuff I get side-tracked by.
